                   <h1 id="ppch1">Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is a digital advertising strategy </h1>
                   <p id="ppcp">that involves placing ads on search engine results pages (SERPs) or other websites for a fee, each time someone clicks on the ad. This form of advertising allows businesses to target specific keywords and demographics and only pay
                       for the ad when it is actually accessed by a potential customer. PPC campaigns are generally managed by specialist marketing agencies or platforms and can be an effective way to quickly drive targeted traffic to a website or online
                       store.
